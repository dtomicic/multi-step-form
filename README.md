## Project task
The task was to build out a multi-step form where user should be able to input his information, select the plan (only one) and pick addons (user can pick none, one, two or all three addons), select the billing (monthly or yearly) and in  the end user should get a "checkout" page with all of his choices listed and prices displayed accordingly. Upon confirming user should get a confirmation screen.
